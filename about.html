          <p>Since an early age I have been immersed in my family's engineering tradition, dating back to my great grandfather who was an electrical engineer for Cuba's first power company, down to my father who is a successful mechanical engineer back home in Puerto Rico. There was a lot of pressure on deciding my path but I found my passion shortly before graduating high school. An introductory course to Java opened my eyes to the world of Computer Science. Since then it's been my main focus academically and in my career. Alongside my Computer Engineering undergraduate degree at Georgia Tech, I pursued a Computer Science minor (Artificial Intelligence track) to satisfy my desire of learning different topics. This allowed me to experience both low-level and high-level technologies, learning Java, Python, C, C++, Javascript and Assembly.</p>
          <p>During my time at Tech, I worked on a variety of projects. For senior design, we developed a structural health monitoring system with an internet of things approach. Although I worked across the full stack, my main focus was developing the analytics engine, which consisted of using Kafka, Storm and Ampari in conjunction with Sci-kit machine learning algorithms.</p>
          <p>I currently have seven months of professional experience at IBM. I'm a software engineer working on a NodeJS application that allows users to interact with a RESTful backend to deploy hybrid mobile applications and support enterprise server operations. My expertise has allowed me to quickly gain more responsibilities within the team.</p>
